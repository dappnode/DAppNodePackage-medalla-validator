#### Let's get you started running an ETH2.0 validator on Prysm's testnet.

###### You will need:
1. Prysm's [onboarding website](https://prylabs.net/participate?node=dappnode)
2. Follow the steps below.

Once you've opened the [participate](https://prylabs.net/participate?node=dappnode) site:

* **Follow** step 1 "Get GöETH — Test ether", as per Prysm's faucet steps.

* **Follow** step 2 [Download deposit data](http://my.dappnode/#/packages/prysm-validator.public.dappnode.eth/file-manager?from=%2Fdata%2Fdeposit_data.txt) file and open it, you will get something like this:

    ========================Deposit Data=======================

    0xbc0000006....

    ===========================================================

    * Copy the value `0xbc0000006...` from the deposit_data.txt file.

    * Paste it in the field `your validator deposit data` of the Prysm's website:

**Congratulations! Now you should have a network validator node on testnet!**
